== Description ==
NS Theme Starter WordPress HTML5 boilerplate starter theme. I have constructed a clean and minimalist theme for designers and developers to use as a base to build websites for clients or to build completely custom themes from scratch. Clean, simple SEO-friendly, jQuery-enabled, white label as possible, and most importantly, no intrusive visual CSS styles have been added whatsoever, a perfect skeleton theme.
